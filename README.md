# Json-Formatter
A JSON formatter built in React by Karan Kumar beautifies and formats JSON data for easy readability. Users can input raw JSON, which is then parsed and displayed with proper indentation. The tool allows customization of font size, color, and weight, and includes features for clearing, copying, and formatting, making JSON handling more efficient.
